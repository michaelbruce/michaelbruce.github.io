## How do I save money?

_By using simple rules._

In september I spent about £1000 in September on food.

That's a lot of money. At least I know now how much I was spending.

### To save money, you first need to understand where it is being spent.

Food wasn't the only thing but it was a huge outlier and I've decided to tackle this problem one stage at a time.

I already know how to cook my own meals and prepare lunches to take to work. In other words I have all the tools I need.

I just need to do it.

### This month I am going to play a game, bringing in food is the only option for lunch.

If I don't bring in anything then I can't buy anything and will have to live off whatever is available in the fruit bowl.

### Only buy uncooked meat from the supermarkets

There is a high markup on cooked meats and deli products like chorizo and smoked sausage. The latter aren't nutritionally beneficial either and should be written off.
Instead cooking raw breast and adding seasoning to make things tasty sounds like a good idea. This simple rule makes it easy to remember what I want to accomplish too.

### Only go to the supermarket twice a week

Being a three minute walk away from the nearest Tesco makes it easy to utilize it like a second fridge.

A £10 shopping trip may not seem like much but it quickly adds up when you're visiting every other day.

## This is only the beginning

I've found it good practice when improving oneself to work incrementally, taking change one step at a time.
When I reduce my food budget, there are plenty of other avenues to follow.
