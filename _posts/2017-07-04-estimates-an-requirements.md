### Estimates and Requirements

A set of actionable requirements is vital to providing good estimates.

#### What is an actionable requirement?

- A description of modification to an existing product at
a level of implementation.

- This description must be understood by the person providing the estimate
in order to ensure that it is accurate.

- *This description should be broken down into it's most atomic state in
an effort to avoid unknown hidden requirements.* For example a requirement
that includes a price derived from an API assumes that the existing product
is able to successfully communicate and use data from this API and that no
seperate work is required as such.

When you understand what you are implementing it is possible to make an estimate.
