Emacs is valued by it's users for being programmable. It's an interpreted lisp environment that just so happens to edit text by default.

I can see the advantage, knowing how to do this however can be difficult starting off and I doubt my own configuration would anything like this without the internet.

Below is a overview for this, I had certain requirements and there are other ways I may have preferred to do this.. [revise]

e.g startup time - under 100ms, currently around 200ms? alternative was to setup emacs server, however I do not know how to save/restore frame configuration.
