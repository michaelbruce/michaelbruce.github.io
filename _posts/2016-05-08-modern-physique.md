# 8 weeks of physical training.

The last 56 days has been an intense ride, I've had so much fun. Maybe it's that summer is just around the corner, here in England the weather has been great during this time.
Today marks the end of a fitness regime from bodybuilding.com, called Modern Physique.

A big shoutout is in order to Steve Cook, bodybuilding.com and everyone involved in putting this together. It's made a huge difference physically, see the before and after.

What I didn't expect was an improvement in mindset, how applying yourself and pushing limits with weights encourages the same changes psychologically. It's been said a thousand times before that exercise brings more benefits than a beach body and boy am I feeling this right now.

It's invigorating, filling me with energy to lead the way with this.

Next week I'll be taking it slowly, indulge and take some time off then I'm going to go for another round.

### Next time

When going at this again, there are a few things I'll be changing. Some are personal but a lot is generally applicable.

#### A Focus on nutrition
The first time round a lot of the know how was picked up as I went along with the program, now I have a better idea of what works for my body.
