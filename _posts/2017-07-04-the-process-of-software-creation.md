### The Process of Software Creation

Deciding on how the creation of software should be approached is still somewhat
of a mystery to me after more than half a decade of professional experience.
There are a few reasons behind this:

- Software tends to grow into a complex system where there are multiple
  authors, instructed by stakeholders who may not understand or know what they
  want.
- Solutions to problems are plentiful and provided in a variety of languages.
- People are not rational and are not guaranteed to act in their own interests
  or that of the business that employs them.

Motivation towards a goal is fragile and something I would like to examine in
greater detail. Receiving another layer of requirements, set upon a foundation
of legacy code by a manager that has little consideration for the work required
seems daunting, I do not think I am alone in saying that this prospect is
demoralising yet at the same time it is a common reality when developing
software. Add to this uncertainty that the output will stay in the product and
you all but guarantee motivational disaster.

I have been in this very situation, like many challenging scenarios breaking
things down into components helps to provide a way forward:

- Gather a set of requirements and write them yourself in a way that you
  understand and are able to implement. This could mean rewriting a set of
  requirements that are presented to you. It is important to do this step
  yourself in order to present a clear picture in your mind what it is that you
  will be doing and identify what is poorly understood.
- *Never rush* your development practices. Whatever you think is best practice,
  it could be TDD or BDD, whatever it is *stick to your principles*. Not doing
  so leads to a drop in code quality raising the likelihood of bugs. I have
  found this personally hard to follow but I am always punished for forgoing
  this rule.
- Give your estimate in days rather than giving a date. Emergencies in production
  happen, we get ill so eliminate these factors in your judgement. If a date
  based deadline is pushed for by the stakeholder then your days estimate is a
  good tool to justify what you are presenting, e.g next wednesday based on 4 days
  estimate and 2 days of emergency, urgent off project work and sickness.
- Stick to the requirements, ensure that everyone is aware that a change in
  the requirements will result in a change to the estimate. Squeezing in extras
  will come at the cost of a drop in quality of delivery and hike of
  maintenance cost altering the maxim of choosing two factors from your product
  being good, fast or cheap.

This set of guidelines helps me to focus my efforts when creating software.
There is always pressure to do things more quickly, the last thing to keep in
mind is to be truthful to yourself and the people you communicate with. In The
Empire Strikes Back, Yoda encourages Luke to commit fully and have certainty in
his ability to achieve his goal, or he will not be able to.
