### Design Courage

Changing a product in a way that customers have not asked is taking a risk.
It takes guts to go spending money on something that nobody asked for when you have determined that it has value.

Courage in design seperates the Apples from the rest of the fruit. It takes a leap of faith
to go where no one else has gone before, where there is no track record to guide your hand.

Without it we can play safe and create the status quo of what is expected; There is no
intention of getting ahead of the competition or entering an uncovered market. We should
not expect the result of such efforts to be rewarded with first place.

Anybody can produce a word processor that defaults to A4 pages or a social media website with likes and reposting.

Have some courage when you design a product.
